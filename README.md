# Automated Sports Highlight Generator with Cinematic Slow-Motion

This project is an automated system that processes full-length football (soccer) match videos to generate short, social-media-ready highlight reels. It uses a combination of audio-visual analysis to detect key moments and applies generative AI for creating high-quality, cinematic slow-motion effects.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  - **Automated Highlight Detection**: Identifies exciting moments like goals, saves, and key plays by analyzing audio peaks (crowd noise) and motion intensity (optical flow) without needing manual intervention or transcripts.
  - **AI-Powered Cinematic Slow-Motion**: Utilizes a Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) model (RIFE) to generate synthetic frames, creating ultra-smooth slow-motion effects that are far superior to traditional frame duplication methods.[1, 2]
  - **Multimodal Analysis**: Fuses audio and video signals to create a robust detection system, reducing false positives and ensuring that moments of high excitement are accurately captured.[3]
  - **End-to-End Pipeline**: Provides a complete workflow from a full match video to a final, edited highlight reel complete with background music.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Libraries

  - **Core Language**: Python 3.x
  - **Video/Audio Processing**:
      - `MoviePy`: For video clip extraction, concatenation, and audio manipulation.
      - `OpenCV`: For all computer vision tasks, primarily calculating dense optical flow for motion analysis.[4]
      - `librosa`: For audio analysis, specifically calculating onset strength and detecting peaks in the audio signal.[5, 6]
      - `ffmpeg`: Required by MoviePy and for decomposing/recomposing video frames for the VFI model.
  - **AI/Deep Learning**:
      - `PyTorch`: The framework used by the recommended RIFE model.
      - **RIFE (Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation)**: The selected state-of-the-art model for video frame interpolation.[7, 1]
  - **General**:
      - `NumPy`: For numerical operations.
      - `SciPy`: For signal interpolation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and run the pipeline.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  - Python 3.7+
  - `ffmpeg`: Ensure it is installed and accessible from your system's PATH. You can download it from [ffmpeg.org](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).
  - A CUDA-enabled GPU is highly recommended for the frame interpolation phase.

### 2\. Installation

1.  \*\*Clone the repository:\*\*bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/automated-highlight-generator.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your-username/automated-highlight-generator.git)
    cd automated-highlight-generator

    ```
    
    ```

2.  **Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Download the Pre-trained RIFE Model:**

      - Download the pre-trained RIFE models. The `Practical-RIFE` fork is recommended.[1]
      - Create a `models` directory in the project root.
      - Place the downloaded model files (e.g., `RIFE_HDv3.py`, `train_log/`) inside the `models/rife` directory.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run

The pipeline is executed via the main orchestration script.

1.  **Place your video file** (e.g., `match.mp4`) into the `videos/input/` directory.

2.  **Run the main script from the project root:**

    ```bash
    python src/main.py --input_video videos/input/match.mp4 --output_video videos/output/highlight_reel.mp4 --music_track path/to/your/music.mp3
    ```

    **Command-line arguments:**

      - `--input_video`: Path to the source video file.
      - `--output_video`: Path where the final highlight reel will be saved.
      - `--music_track` (optional): Path to a background music file to add to the final reel.
      - `--slowdown_factor` (optional): The interpolation factor for slow-motion. Defaults to `4` (for 4x slow-motion).
      - `--config` (optional): Path to a configuration file for detection parameters (e.g., thresholds, window sizes).

The script will:

1.  Analyze the full video for audio and motion events.
2.  Identify and timestamp candidate highlight clips.
3.  Extract each clip.
4.  Apply RIFE for smooth slow-motion enhancement.
5.  Concatenate the enhanced clips.
6.  Add the background music track.
7.  Save the final video to the specified output path.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

The current system uses a heuristic-based approach for event detection. The next evolution of this project will focus on achieving true semantic understanding of game events.

  - **Transition to Supervised Learning**: Replace the heuristic detection module with a dedicated action spotting model.
  - **Advanced Architecture**: Implement a state-of-the-art architecture using **YOLOv8** for object detection (players, ball) and a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** to analyze player interactions and game state.[8]
  - **Semantic Event Recognition**: Train the model on a large-scale dataset like **SoccerNet** to enable the system to identify specific actions such as "Goal," "Foul," "Corner," and "Shot on target," leading to more contextually relevant highlights.[9]
